# bp-comp-challenge-1

The project was to create a comp of the provided page. The page needed to be resposive, but the theme and look could change. Once I decided on the theme, I pulled a color from the main image and created a monocromatic pallet in Koler. The poster was fairly monochromatic so this made the most since. Based on the font in the image I decided to use a similar, but easy to read serif font.
